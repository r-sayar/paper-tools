Has anyone developed a machine learning model to determine what small changes in the transcriptome  (e.g., those encoding transcriptions factors, ...) lead to major transcriptome changes (the resulting phenotypes) which eventually determine cell fate?

# Response
Yes. Based on the relevant papers, several machine learning models have been developed to link small transcriptomic changes—specifically in transcription factor expression or activity—to major transcriptomic remodeling that drives cell fate determination (appleton2023machineguidedcellfateengineering pages 1-3). For example, the CellCartographer platform uses chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles to predict effective transcription factor combinations, thereby linking subtle transcriptomic changes to large-scale cell fate transitions (appleton2023machineguidedcellfateengineering pages 3-5). 

Similarly, an interpretable machine learning framework has been used to identify key molecules, including transcription factors, that significantly impact cell fate decisions by quantifying their influence in molecular networks (he2023identifyingkeyfactors pages 1-3). Parallel work involving computational models that account for dynamic changes in transcription factor binding motifs has demonstrated how small perturbations near transcription start sites relate to substantial changes in gene expression during differentiation processes (stone2019contextspecifictranscriptionfactor pages 21-22). 

Further evidence is provided by studies that integrate deep learning with dynamical systems theory. For instance, the Fatecode method employs a classification autoencoder to simulate latent transcriptomic perturbations—which include transcription factor alterations—resulting in dramatic shifts in cell type distributions (sadria2022fatecodecellfate pages 1-4), while FateNet extends this concept by predicting bifurcation dynamics in differentiation with minimal gene perturbations (sadria2024fatenetanintegration pages 1-3). Moreover, FateNet’s in silico experiments show that modifying the expression of a critical set of genes, many of which are transcription factors, can change the predictive trajectory of cell fate decisions, demonstrating the quantitative link between small changes and major phenotypic outcomes (sadria2024fatenetanintegration pages 5-9).

In addition, decision tree models have been applied to single-cell transcriptomic data to determine the minimal perturbations—particularly in transcription factors—that necessarily shift cell phenotypes from one state to another (veleslavov2020decisiontreemodels pages 1-3), with follow-up analyses quantifying the cumulative gene expression changes required for such transitions (veleslavov2020decisiontreemodels pages 7-8). 

Other work combines single-cell omics data with mathematical modeling to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and identify master transcription factors, whose slight activity changes result in significant cell fate alterations (lee2024decodingtheprinciple pages 9-9, lee2024decodingtheprinciple pages 1-2). Lastly, advanced deep learning models such as ChromBPNet capture cis-regulatory sequence syntax and transcription factor footprints, further reinforcing that small, localized transcriptomic changes can underlie major regulatory shifts that determine cell fate outcomes (pampari2025chrombpnetbiasfactorized pages 76-78).

Together, these studies provide clear evidence that machine learning models have indeed been developed to determine how minor transcriptomic perturbations—particularly those affecting transcription factors—lead to substantial transcriptomic changes that ultimately determine cell fate.
