What machine learning models exist which predict what extrinsic cues and environmental conditions one needs in order to differentiate a progenitor cell into a differentiated cell?

# Response
This report provides an extensive overview of machine learning models that have been developed to predict the extrinsic cues and environmental conditions needed to guide the differentiation of progenitor cells into differentiated states. A number of approaches - from spatial pattern recognition in simulated tissues to deep generative and recurrent network models applied to single-cell gene expression - have been proposed. Although many models do not directly output specific extrinsic biochemical signals, they effectively infer them by capturing the relationship between environmental context and cell fate through spatial, temporal, or molecular features. In the following sections, we describe several categories of machine learning frameworks along with examples from the literature, discuss the underlying computational principles, and outline challenges and future research directions.

I. Overview of Spatial and Neighborhood Information-Based Models

One prominent strategy is the use of spatial information from cell neighborhood patterns to infer the effective extrinsic cues that drive progenitor differentiation. For example, models have been developed to predict cell fate by considering the fate and spatial arrangement of a cell’s immediate neighbors. In simulated tissues, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) were trained using features such as the fates of seven or more adjacent cells in two-dimensional simulations, as well as in three-dimensional organoid models where optimal performance was observed using 12 to 14 neighbors. These models have demonstrated high prediction accuracy, indicating that the local microenvironment embeds sufficient information to infer extrinsic signals that govern cell fate decisions (dirk2023recognitionandreconstruction pages 17-20). Moreover, graph neural network (GNN) architectures have been successfully employed on synthetic graphs that represent intercellular interactions, thereby predicting environmental signal parameters such as a dispersion coefficient that indirectly reflect long-range diffusion or coupling cues present in the microenvironment (dirk2023recognitionandreconstruction pages 9-11). Such approaches directly capture spatial dynamics and support the hypothesis that extrinsic signals are encoded in the neighborhood context, even though the models may not explicitly resolve the molecular nature of the cues.

II. Deep Learning Models Based on Gene Expression and Time-Series Data

Another line of work leverages single-cell transcriptomic data and lineage tracing techniques to predict differentiation outcomes and, by extension, the environmental factors that influence them. Deep learning frameworks such as Deep Lineage integrate autoencoder-based representation learning with recurrent neural networks - specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and bidirectional LSTMs - to analyze high-dimensional gene expression data over developmental time. These architectures capture the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions and have been used to forecast early fate bias with high accuracy, thereby indirectly inferring the extrinsic perturbations and dynamic environmental conditions that alter gene regulatory network states (sadria2024deeplineagesinglecell pages 17-19, sadria2024deeplearningmodels pages 193-197). By training on sequential data from lineage tracing experiments, these methods not only predict the future state of progenitor cells but also provide mechanistic insights into how extrinsic factors such as secreted signaling molecules or mechanical forces alter the trajectory of differentiation.

Some deep learning approaches combine the power of unsupervised dimensionality reduction with supervised classification or regression tasks. For instance, classification-supervised autoencoders are employed to extract latent representations from single-cell RNA sequencing data, which are then used to identify gene regulatory factors and simulate in silico perturbations. Such models have been shown to predict how progenitor cells respond to external cues by capturing the underlying gene expression dynamics without prior specification of the environmental signal details (sadria2024deeplearningmodels pages 48-53). Although the output focuses on gene regulators, these findings suggest that once the system’s intrinsic regulatory network is sufficiently understood, one can back-infer what extrinsic signals are likely necessary to drive a progenitor toward a particular differentiated state.

III. Generative Modeling and Diffusion-Based Approaches

Generative models present another compelling strategy by treating the differentiation process as a continuous stochastic process on a latent gene expression landscape. The PRESCIENT framework, for example, formulates cellular differentiation as a diffusion over a potential landscape modeled by a neural network. This framework minimizes a regularized Wasserstein loss between observed cell populations and model predictions over time, thereby generating simulated trajectories under different perturbation conditions. By simulating the effects of altering extrinsic signals such as ligand concentrations or mechanical stimuli, generative models like PRESCIENT can predict how the progenitor cell state might change in response to environmental interventions (yeo2021generativemodelingof pages 1-2). Although these methods are typically applied to forecasting cell fate outcomes, they represent a promising approach for designing in silico experiments that specify how altering external cues might reprogram differentiation trajectories.

IV. Models Integrating Metabolomics and Biochemical Signatures

In addition to models based on spatial or transcriptomic data, there have been efforts to use supervised models on metabolomics data to characterize the biochemical environment requisite for differentiation. For example, XGBoost, a gradient-boosted decision tree method, has been applied to metabolite profiles from mesenchymal stem cells cultured in two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions. By using Boruta feature selection and collinearity correction, the model was able to identify key metabolites - such as fumarate and myo-inositol - that correlate with effective differentiation outcomes (klontzas2024machinelearningand pages 4-7). Even though the model’s output pertains primarily to metabolomic signatures, these compounds are reflective of the extrinsic biochemical environment, thereby enabling indirect prediction of conditions that foster successful differentiation.

V. Neural Network-Based Models Incorporating Mechanistic Gene Regulatory Network Dynamics

Several studies have also sought to integrate mechanistic insights into standard neural network approaches. Neural network models of associative gene regulatory networks (AGRN), for instance, can store multilineage stage-specific gene expression profiles and respond dynamically to various extrinsic instructive signals such as mechanical forces or signaling factors. By modeling the combinatorial interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory modules, such associative memory models capture attractor dynamics corresponding to differentiated states and can simulate the response to external triggers (paczko2024aneuralnetworkbased pages 1-2). Although these models are less common than purely data-driven deep learning methods, they offer a complementary perspective that bridges top-down mechanistic understanding with data-driven prediction by directly integrating extrinsic cues into the modeled regulatory network dynamics.

VI. Learning-Theory-Inspired Models and GRN Simulations

A further class of models emerges from the analogy between evolving gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and learning systems. Conceptual frameworks have been developed in which the mapping of environmental cues to phenotypic outcomes is represented as a multidimensional Boolean logical function. These models simulate the processing of extrinsic signals by continuous GRN dynamics and demonstrate that progenitor cells may employ inductive biases favoring simpler input-output mappings. Such biases enable cells to respond robustly to external fluctuations and to generalize from incomplete environmental information (brunusan2020howtofit pages 2-4, brunusan2020howtofit pages 4-5). Although these models do not use conventional machine learning algorithms directly, they provide a theoretical underpinning for why certain machine learning architectures, particularly those that incorporate modular or sparse connectivity, may be well suited for predicting the necessary external conditions to drive differentiation.

VII. Predictive Models Based on Imaging Data and Morphological Profiling

Recent advances in deep learning applied to imaging data have yielded models that predict differentiation outcomes from morphological and biophysical features captured in bright-field or phase contrast images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to classify the differentiation status of neural stem cells and other progenitor cells from imaging data without the need for artificial markers. In one study, an improved Xception-based architecture was adopted to reduce model complexity and enhance detection performance, yielding early predictions of cell fate based on subtle morphological state changes. Although these models do not explicitly output the extrinsic cues that triggered the morphological alterations, they effectively serve as proxies by correlating image-derived features with known inducing conditions, thereby indirectly inferring the environmental factors necessary for effective differentiation (zhu2021deeplearningbasedpredictive pages 8-9).

VIII. Integration and Future Directions

While individual categories of models have shown promise in capturing aspects of the extrinsic environment - from local spatial cues and transcriptomic changes to metabolomics and imaging features - one significant challenge remains: integrating multiple data modalities to provide a more comprehensive prediction of environmental conditions. Hybrid models that combine mechanistic insights from GRN simulations (as in GRN-based Boolean and differential equation models) with data-driven approaches (such as deep generative networks and recurrent architectures) may ultimately prove most effective. Recent reviews have highlighted the need for multi-modal datasets - including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging data - to train more robust models that can predict not only cell fate but also elucidate the precise extrinsic cues (e.g., growth factors, extracellular matrix components, oxygenation levels) necessary to steer progenitor cells toward a desired differentiated state (ham2025mappingmodelingand pages 9-11).

Furthermore, the integration of lineage tracing methods and perturbation experiments within deep learning frameworks, as evidenced by the Deep Lineage approach, offers an exciting pathway forward. By combining time-resolved single-cell gene expression with clonal lineage information, these methods provide quantitative measures of how extrinsic signals alter differentiation trajectories. Such integrative strategies will likely benefit from transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques, enabling models trained on simulated or in vitro experimental data to be generalized to more complex in vivo environments.

In conclusion, a diverse array of machine learning models exists that indirectly or directly predict the environmental cues required for progenitor cell differentiation. Spatial models using GNNs and MLPs extract local neighbor information to infer extrinsic signal parameters; deep recurrent networks and autoencoder-based pipelines analyze temporal gene expression dynamics to forecast cell fate decisions; generative diffusion models and XGBoost techniques extract biochemical and morphological profiles; associative gene regulatory network models and GRN simulations provide mechanistic frameworks inspired by learning theory; and convolutional neural network-based image classification models capture morphological changes reflective of environmental conditions. Each of these approaches contributes unique insights into how extrinsic factors can be inferred from complex biological data, though challenges remain in combining and validating these models across different experimental systems (dirk2023recognitionandreconstruction pages 17-20, sadria2024deeplearningmodels pages 193-197, yeo2021generativemodelingof pages 1-2, klontzas2024machinelearningand pages 4-7, paczko2024aneuralnetworkbased pages 1-2, brunusan2020howtofit pages 2-4, zhu2021deeplearningbasedpredictive pages 8-9). Future work will likely focus on hybrid models capable of integrating multi-modal data and explicit environmental parameters, improving both the predictive power and mechanistic interpretability of these computational frameworks.

Overall, these advances represent important steps toward developing comprehensive, predictive models that will aid in the rational design of in vitro differentiation protocols, facilitate early decision-making in experimental setups, and ultimately provide deeper insights into the interplay between intrinsic gene regulatory networks and extrinsic environmental signals during cell differentiation.
